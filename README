These are various demos of iPhone Applications, I have developed.


iPhoneAugmentedTest
--------------------

This is a sample application using the NyARToolkit library for finding a marker from a sample image.

Most of the code is based on the tutorial posted at:

http://www.morethantechnical.com/2009/07/01/augmented-reality-on-the-iphone-using-nyartoolkit-w-code/

OpenGL ES1 is used rendering, so you could ignore all shaders related code. 

Compiled and works on XCode 3.2.5 SDK iOS 4.2


iPhoneAugmentedVideo
-------------------
A sample application for live single marker detection from the iPhone Camera. 

I use the AVFoundation for extrating every frame from the video and NyARToolkitCPP 2.5.4 for the marker detection.

Compiled and works on XCode 3.2.5 SDK iOS 4.2

Part of the code is based on the tutorial at:

http://www.morethantechnical.com/2009/07/01/augmented-reality-on-the-iphone-using-nyartoolkit-w-code/

but it is slightly modified in order to work with the latest NyARToolkitCPP version.
