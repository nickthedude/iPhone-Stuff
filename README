These are various demos of iPhone Applications, I have developed.


iPhoneAugmentedTest
--------------------

This is a sample application using the NyARToolkit library for finding a marker from a sample image.

Most of the code is based on the tutorial posted at:

http://www.morethantechnical.com/2009/07/01/augmented-reality-on-the-iphone-using-nyartoolkit-w-code/

OpenGL ES1 is used rendering, so you could ignore all shaders related code. 

Compiled and works on XCode 3.2.5 SDK iOS 4.2
