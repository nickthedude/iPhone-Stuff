These are various demos of iPhone Applications, I have developed.


iPhoneAugmentedTest
--------------------
This is a sample application using the NyARToolkit library for finding a marker from a sample image.
The code use OpenGL ES1 for rendering, so you could ignore all shaders related code. 

Compiled and works on XCode 3.2.5 SDK iOS 4.2
